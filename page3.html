<p style="font-size:120%">In this paragraph i will be able to discuss modern folks that developed and still developing the factitious intelligence, one in every of the best one is elon musk.Elon Musk has spoken out against computer science (AI), declaring it the foremost serious threat to the survival of the civilization. Musk made the comments to students from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) during an interview at the AeroAstro Centennial Symposium, talking about computing, AI, space exploration and therefore the colonisation of Mars. أ¢€إ“I think we should be very careful about computing . If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, itأ¢€â„¢s probably that. So we want to be very careful,أ¢€â€Œ said Musk. أ¢€إ“Iأ¢€â„¢m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to create sure that we donأ¢€â„¢t do something very foolish.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">He recently described his investments in AI research as â€œkeeping an eye on what’s going onâ€‌, rather than viable return on capital. â€œWith artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon. In all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and therefore the water , it’s like â€“ yeah, he’s sure he can control the demon. Doesn’t work out,â€‌ said Musk.</p>
