<p style="font-size:120%">When most of the people hear the term AI , the primary thing they typically consider is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">Artificial intelligence is predicated on the principle that human intelligence are often defined during a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the foremost simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of AI include learning, reasoning, and perception.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined AI become outdated. for instance , machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character recognition aren't any more considered to embody AI , since this function is now taken without any consideration as an inherent computer function.</p>
